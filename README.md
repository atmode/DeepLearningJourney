## Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks. My journey began with a curiosity about how machines can learn from data and make intelligent decisions. Over time, I have developed a passion for building models that can solve complex problems.

## Goals

- **Understand the Fundamentals**: Gain a solid understanding of the mathematical concepts and theories behind deep learning.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Build and train various deep learning models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Real-World Applications**: Apply deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems, such as image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest research and advancements in the field of deep learning.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on during my deep learning journey:

- **Image Classification with CNNs**: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Built a sentiment analysis model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze movie reviews.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Created a GAN to generate realistic images based on training data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented a reinforcement learning agent to play games and optimize strategies.

Each project has its own repository with detailed documentation and code.

## Learning Resources

Here are some valuable resources that have helped me along the way:

### Books:
